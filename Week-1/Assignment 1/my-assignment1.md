The set of protocols used in a communications network. A protocol stack is a prescribed hierarchy of software layers, starting from the application layer at the top (the source of the data being sent) to the data link layer at the bottom (transmitting the bits on the wire). The stack resides in each client and server, and the layered approach lets different protocols be swapped in and out to accommodate different network architectures

Types of Layers in Stack: 

Application Layer
Transport Layer
Network Layer
Link Layer
