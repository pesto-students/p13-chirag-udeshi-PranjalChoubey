Scaling webservers refers to the process of increasing a website's capacity to handle more users, traffic, and requests. As a website grows in popularity, it may experience increased load, leading to slower response times and potential crashes. Scaling helps ensure that the website remains accessible and responsive even during high traffic periods.

There are two types of scalling Horiontal and Vertical, there are few diffrences between the two and which mainly are:


Horizontal scaling means scaling by adding more machines to your pool of resources, whereas vertical scaling refers to scaling by adding more power (e.g. CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.

One of the fundamental differences between the two is that horizontal scaling requires breaking a sequential piece of logic into smaller pieces so that they can be executed in parallel across multiple machines. In many respects, vertical scaling is easier because the logic really doesn’t need to change. Rather, you’re just running the same code on higher-spec machines. However, there are many other factors to consider when determining the appropriate approach.
